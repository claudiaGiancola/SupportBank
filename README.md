# Support Bank

Writing an expense tracker console application in C# with an Object-Oriented Programming approach.

### Development
- Planning with an OOP perspective
- Reading a .csv file and process its data to store them as transactions and accounts
- Allow the program to list either all the transactions or only a specific accountâ€™s transactions
- Refactoring the code and creating new classes and static methods so that the program could also read .json and .xlm files
- Allow the program to list all the files contained in a specific directory
- Allow the user to input new transactions and output the result as a .csv file
- Implementing logging and exception handling using NLog (from the NuGet Package Manager)
